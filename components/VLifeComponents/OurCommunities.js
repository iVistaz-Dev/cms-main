            Individual farmers, particularly small and marginal farmers, often
            struggle with financial barriers that limit their ability to invest
            in their farms. These barriers include a lack of collateral, limited
            credit history, and complex banking processes. Without access to
            affordable credit, farmers face difficulties in purchasing seeds,
            fertilizers, equipment, and other essential inputs, leading to
            reduced productivity and income instability.
