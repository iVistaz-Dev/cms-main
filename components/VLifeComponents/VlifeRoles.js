          Working Capital Loans
        </h2>
      
        <p className="text-xl font-light mt-4 p-3">
          FPOs need working capital to purchase inputs, manage inventory, and
          cover operational expenses. V-Life facilitates working capital loans
          that are tailored to the cash flow cycles of FPOs, ensuring that they
          have the necessary funds to operate smoothly.

        <p className="text-xl font-light mt-4 p-3">
          For FPOs looking to invest in infrastructure such as storage
          facilities, processing units, or transportation, V-Life provides
          long-term loans with flexible repayment terms. These loans enable FPOs
          to enhance their value-addition capabilities and improve market access.

          Revolving Credit Lines
        </h2>
        <p className="text-xl font-light mt-4 p-3">
          Similar to individual farmers, FPOs can benefit from revolving credit
          lines that provide them with ongoing access to funds. This flexibility
          allows FPOs to manage cash flows effectively and respond to changing
          market conditions.
